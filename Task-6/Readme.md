# âœ¨ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classification

## ðŸŽ¯ Program Purpose
- Understand and implement the KNN classification algorithm.
- Explore how instance-based learning works using distance metrics.
- Visualize how different values of K affect classification boundaries.

## ðŸ›  What We Do
- Load and normalize the Iris dataset features.
- Split data into training and testing sets.
- Train KNN classifiers with various K values.
- Evaluate model accuracy and visualize confusion matrices.
- Plot decision boundaries to interpret classifier behavior visually.

## âš¡ Why It Is Efficient
- KNN is simple, effective, and non-parametric (no explicit training phase).
- Works well on small to medium datasets.
- Sensitive to feature scaling and choice of K.
- Decision boundaries adapt naturally to data shape.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python 3
- numpy, pandas (data processing)
- scikit-learn (KNN model, scaling, metrics)
- matplotlib (plots and visualizations)

## ðŸ“š What You Will Learn
- How to preprocess and normalize data for KNN.
- The impact of different K values on model accuracy.
- How to interpret confusion matrices.
- Visualizing classifier decision boundaries for better intuition.
