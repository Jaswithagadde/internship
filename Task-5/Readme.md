# âœ¨ Decision Trees and Random Forests Classification

## ðŸŽ¯ Program Purpose
- Demonstrate classification using tree-based machine learning models.
- Show how decision trees split data based on feature thresholds.
- Use random forests to improve accuracy by combining multiple trees.

## ðŸ›  What We Do
- Load and preprocess the Breast Cancer dataset.
- Train a Decision Tree classifier and visualize its structure.
- Control tree depth to reduce overfitting.
- Train a Random Forest classifier and compare its accuracy to a single tree.
- Analyze feature importance from the Random Forest.
- Evaluate models using cross-validation for robustness.

## âš¡ Why It Is Efficient
- Decision Trees are intuitive and fast for training and prediction.
- Random Forests reduce overfitting and variance by averaging multiple trees.
- Feature importance helps identify which features matter most.
- Cross-validation ensures model performance is consistent on unseen data.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python 3
- pandas, numpy (data handling)
- scikit-learn (models, evaluation)
- matplotlib (visualization)
- (Optional) graphviz for detailed tree visualization

## ðŸ“š What You Will Learn
- How to train and tune decision trees and random forests.
- Methods to visualize tree structure and feature importance.
- How to detect and mitigate overfitting.
- Cross-validation techniques to assess model generalization.
