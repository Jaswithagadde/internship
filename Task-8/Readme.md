# K-Means Clustering with Synthetic Data

This project demonstrates how to apply **K-Means Clustering** using a simple, synthetic dataset generated with `sklearn.datasets.make_blobs`. It is ideal for learning and experimenting with unsupervised learning techniques.

## 📌 What This Project Does

- Generates a 2D dataset with predefined clusters
- Uses the **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters
- Applies **K-Means Clustering**
- Visualizes the clusters and centroids
- Evaluates the clustering using **Silhouette Score**

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- Python 3
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install required libraries (if not already installed):
pip install matplotlib scikit-learn

🤖 Learning Objectives
Understand how K-Means clustering works

Learn to choose the right number of clusters using the Elbow Method
