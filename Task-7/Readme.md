# Support Vector Machines (SVM) - Breast Cancer Classification

This project demonstrates how to use Support Vector Machines (SVM) for both linear and non-linear (RBF) classification using the Breast Cancer dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, visualization, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

**Breast Cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic Dataset**

This dataset is included in Scikit-learn and consists of features computed from a digitized image of a breast mass. It is used for binary classification (malignant vs benign).

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (>= 3.6).
2. Install dependencies:
   pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
