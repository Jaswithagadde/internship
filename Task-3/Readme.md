# 🧠 Linear Regression Project (Simple & Multiple)
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Simple** and **Multiple Linear Regression** using Python and libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**.

## 📌 Objective
- Understand and apply **Linear Regression** for predicting house prices.
- Learn how to evaluate models using metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R².
- Visualize results and interpret model coefficients.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset is **synthetically generated** with features like:
- `sqft_living` – Square footage of the house
- `bedrooms` – Number of bedrooms
- `bathrooms` – Number of bathrooms
- `price` – Target value (house price)

> 💡 Two versions are available:
> - With random noise (more realistic)
> - Without noise (perfectly linear relationship)


📈 What’s Inside?
Simple Linear Regression: Uses sqft_living to predict price
Multiple Linear Regression: Uses sqft_living, bedrooms, and bathrooms
Evaluation Metrics: MAE, MSE, R²
Visualization: Regression line plotted for simple model
